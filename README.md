# EXP.NO.4-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-LINE-CODEING-TECHNIQUES
  
## AIM    
 The objective of this experiment is to study the Line coding techniques using the trainer kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE

1. Connect power supply in proper polarity to the kits DCL-05 and DCL-06 and switch iton. 
2. Connect CLOCK and DATA generated on DCL-05 to CODING CLOCK IN and 
DATA INPUT respectively by means of the patch-chords provided. 
3. Connect the coded data NRZ-L on DCL-05 to the corresponding DATA INPUTNRZL, of 
the decoding logic on DCL-06. 
4. Keep the switch SW2 for NRZ-L to ON position for decoding logic as shown in theblock 
diagram. 
5. Observe the coded and decoded signal on the oscilloscope. 
6. Connect the coded data NRZ-M on DCL-05 to the corresponding DATA INPUTNRZM, of 
the decoding logic on DCL-06. 
7. Keep the switch SW2 for NRZ –M to ON position for decoding logic as shown in theblock 
diagram. 
8. Observe the coded and decoded signal on the oscilloscope. 
9. Connect the code data NRZ-S on DCL-05 to the corresponding DATA INPUT NRZ-S, of 
the decoding logic on DCL-06. 
10. Keep the switch SW2 for NRZ-S to ON position for decoding logic as shown in theblock 
diagram. 
11. Observe the coded and decoded signal on the oscilloscope. 
12. Use RESET switch for clear data observation if necessary. 
13. Unipolar to Bipolar/Bipolar to Unipolar: 
a. connect NRZ-L signal from DCL-05 to the input post IN Unipolar to Bipolarand 
Observe the Bipolar output at the post OUT. 
b. Then connect bipolar output signal to the input post IN of Bipolar to Unipolarand 
observe Unipolar out at post OUT.
